           <p>
              I have always been interested in technology and the sciences but ,as often happens, life had other plans for me. I spent years working in customer service and in the hoarding and organizing business. In early 2017 life changes inspired me to go back to school and take a different direction in life. 
           <p>
              I completed my associates in less than two years and then had to decide where to go from there. I was lucky enough to have multiple people recommend computer programing to me, and I'm so glad I listened! I discovered something that I take great pride in doing.
